# A Ruby client for Patchboard APIs

## Installation

We provide Bundler support as a courtesy:

    gem install bundler && bundle && bundle exec rake test

However, internally, we mostly use this:

    gem install rake && gem install starter && rake gem:deps && rake test

Although it's a little more to learn, in terms of the actual code, it's less
complicated.
